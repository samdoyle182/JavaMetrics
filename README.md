Brewing the Numbers Behind U.S. Coffee Import
---------
Purpose:
==
COVID-19 changed many aspects of everyday life. As time goes on after COVID, researchers are looking to see if COVID had any long-lasting effects. One area that might have potential impacts is importing goods into the U.S. Coffee is consumed by millions of Americans every day, but almost all the coffee Americans drink is imported from other countries. This report aims to compare the imported coffee in U.S.D. pre-COVID and post- COVID to see if there are lasting impacts from the 2020 pandemic on the importation of coffee products. The primary statistical methods used to investigate this question will be simple linear regression and ANOVA testing. Some t-Tests will be conducted, as well.
